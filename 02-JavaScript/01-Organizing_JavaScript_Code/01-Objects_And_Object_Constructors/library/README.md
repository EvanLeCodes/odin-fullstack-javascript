## Library App

[*Library App Project*](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/library)
following The Odin Project [JavaScript course](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript).

This project is about building a small Library app using plain old JavaScript Objects and Object Constructors.

## Notes

Based on [this lesson](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/objects-and-object-constructors?ref=lnav).

I really wanted to go through the history of JavaScript fast, so I did not really invest much time in designing a nice UI, but focused on using objects, object constructors and vanilla JavaScript instead to understand the JavaScript progression. 

One feature I will add in the future is data persistence; right now, this app is not able to store any change.
