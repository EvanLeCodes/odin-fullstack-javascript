## Etch-A-Sketch

[*Etch-A-Sketch*](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project)
following The Odin Project [Web Development 101](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101).

This project is about building a Etch-A-Sketch browser version based on JavaScript. 

## Notes

I use CSS Grid Layout in this project.

I should move the buttons to have them on the side instead, so they do not take space from the main square. Added to trello board as a future improvement.
