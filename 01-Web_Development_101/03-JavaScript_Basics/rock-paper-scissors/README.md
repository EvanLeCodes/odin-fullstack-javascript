## Rock Paper Scissors

[*Rock Paper Scissors*](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/rock-paper-scissors)
following The Odin Project [Web Development 101](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101).

This project is about building a Rock Paper Scissors game based on JavaScript. 

## Notes

The UI is not the goal in this project, so I did focus on the JavaScript part instead, there is no UI. 

game.js is just the JavaScript console game.

I will come back here at some point and build a UI, task added to my trello board.
